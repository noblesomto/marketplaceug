# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can obtain your authentication token by logging in through the `/api/login` endpoint. The token should be included in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for all authenticated requests.
